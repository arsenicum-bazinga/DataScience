        "A lot of phenomena in nature exhibit linear dependance, therefore require using linear algebra. There are several techniques that increase the efficiency of computations, like LU and Cholesky decompositions. The purpose of this study is to find LU decomposition of matrix $A$, use it to calculate inverse and to compare this result to inverse function in numpy library. It was found that the condition number of matrix A is $10^{3}$ which is consistent with error of $10^{-13}$ we get from calculating matrix inverse. Also, nunpy implementation was 40 times faster than my code.\n",

        "One of the standard ways to solve a system of linear equations $Ax=b$ is Gauss elimination. Oftetimes we need to solve this system for several different $b$ vectors and in this case Gauss elimination is not very efficient. If we are able to decompose $A$ into a product of lower-triangular matrix $L$ and upper-triangular matrix $U$, we gain a boost in computational efficiency.  \n",
